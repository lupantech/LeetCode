### Problem
Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.

For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

**Note**:

Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.


### Analysis
方法一：复制临时数组
- 时间复杂度O(n)，空间复杂度O(n) 

方法二：逐个推移
- 时间复杂度O(n)，空间复杂度O(1) 

方法三：翻转
- 时间复杂度O(n)，空间复杂度O(1)
