### Problem
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation `00000000000000000000000000001011`, so the function should return 3.

**Note**:

The input is assumed to be a 32-bit signed integer. Your function should return 0 when the reversed integer overflows.


### Analysis
n & (n - 1) drops the lowest set bit. It's a neat little bit trick.

Let's use n = 00101100 as an example. This binary representation has three 1s.

If n = 00101100, then n - 1 = 00101011, so n & (n - 1) = 00101100 & 00101011 = 00101000. Count = 1.

If n = 00101000, then n - 1 = 00100111, so n & (n - 1) = 00101000 & 00100111 = 00100000. Count = 2.

If n = 00100000, then n - 1 = 00011111, so n & (n - 1) = 00100000 & 00011111 = 00000000. Count = 3.

n is now zero, so the while loop ends, and the final count (the numbers of set bits) is returned.
